# Contributing to ImagoRef

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ImagoRef! Your interest and effort help make this project better for everyone. We welcome any contribution, whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, improving documentation, or writing code.

To ensure a smooth and effective process for everyone, please take a moment to read through these guidelines.

### Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the ImagoRef Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior.

### How Can I Contribute?

#### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please ensure the following before creating an issue:

1) You are using the latest version of ImagoRef.
2) You have checked the existing Issues to see if a similar bug has already been reported.

If the bug is new, please create a new issue and provide as much information as possible:

* A clear and descriptive title that summarizes the problem.
* Steps to reproduce the bug. Be as specific as possible.
* What was the expected behavior?
* What was the actual behavior? (Include screenshots if helpful).
* Your system information: Operating System, Qt version (if known), etc.

#### Suggesting Enhancements
We are always open to new ideas! If you have a suggestion for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please create a new issue:

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Explain in detail what problem your idea solves.
* Describe how you imagine the new feature should work. Mockups or diagrams are welcome!

### Development and Submitting Changes
If you want to fix a bug or implement a new feature, hereâ€™s how to get started.

#### 1) Setting Up Your Environment
To build the project, you will need:

* Git
* A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC on Windows, GCC/Clang on Linux/macOS)
* CMake (version 3.16 or higher)
* The Qt library (Qt 6.x is recommended)

**Build Steps:**

```bash
#clone your fork of the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hemaxa/ImagoRef.git
cd ImagoRef

#create a build directory (for an out-of-source build)
mkdir build
cd build

#configure the project using CMake
#if Qt is not in your system's PATH, you must provide the path to it:
#cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/your/qt/version
cmake ..

#build the project
cmake --build .
```

#### 2) Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository (click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page).

2. **Create a new branch** in your fork for your changes. Use a descriptive name for the branch, for example:

```bash
#for a new feature
git checkout -b feature/add-image-rotation

#for a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/crash-on-drag-drop
```

3. **Make your changes.** Write clean code that follows the project's existing style.

4. **Commit your changes.** Use clear and concise commit messages.

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add image rotation with QTransform"
```

5. **Push your changes** to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/add-image-rotation
```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to the *main* branch of the original ImagoRef repository.

* Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
* If your PR fixes an existing issue, link it by including *Closes #123* (where *123* is the issue number) in the PR description.

#### 3) Coding Style
To maintain a clean and readable codebase, please try to follow these guidelines:

* **Consistency:** follow the coding style already present in the project. It is generally close to the official Qt/C++ style guide.
* **Naming:** use *camelCase* for variables and functions. Class names should use *PascalCase* (*MyCoolClass*).
* **Comments:** add comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of your code.

Thank you again for your contribution!
